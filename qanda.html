  <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>

  <h2>What is the difference between chemical energy and nuclear energy?</h2>

  <p>Chemical energy is stored in the bonds between atoms.  There are
    about 90 different kinds of naturally occuring atoms in the
    <a href="https://inl.gov/periodic-table/">periodic table of the
    elements</a>, and there are an enormous number of different ways
    they can bond together into molecules and solids.</p>

  <p>Nuclear energy is stored in the bonds between nucleons in the
    atomic nucleus.  There are only two kinds of nucleons - protons
    and neutrons, and they can bond together in only about 250 stable
    configurations in the
    <a href="https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html">
      table of isotopes</a>.  Essentially all of the ways nucleons can
    bond together have been explored using particle accelerators,
    although there is still active research adding a few more very
    heavy isotopes and refining measurements of excited states of
    nuclei.</p>

  <p>In the US, Brookhaven National Lab produces,
    <a href="https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat3/">collects</a>, and archives
    data about nuclei and all their properties.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, you often see the statement that nuclear energy
    comes from converting small amounts of mass into energy according
    to $E=mc^2.$ While this is not false, it is also true of
    chemical energy or any other form of energy storage.  That was
    Einstein's whole point when he wrote the formula!  For example,
    two hydrogen molecules plus an oxygen molecule weigh slightly more
    than two water molecules, by exactly the amount of energy released
    in the chemical reaction.  A charged battery will weigh ever so
    slightly more than a discharged one, and so on.  For chemical
    bonds or energy levels in atoms, the mass difference is just
    barely on the edge of detectability - roughly parts per billion.
    Nuclear bonds store of order a million times more energy than
    chemical bonds, so mass differences between reactants and products
    are of order parts per thousand.  Weighing atomic nuclei (usually
    with a mass spectrometer) with an accuracy better than a tenth of
    a percent is therefore a viable technique for measuring nuclear
    bonding energies, which is doubtless where the misleading idea
    that $E=mc^2$ has anything to do with nuclear energy arose.</p>

  <h2>What are nuclear fission and nuclear fusion?</h2>

  <p>Nuclear fission refers to the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus
    into lighter pieces.  Heavy nuclei need more and more neutrons to
    keep them stable.  (The attractive forces between nucleons are
    very strong but have a very short range compared to the electrical
    repulsive force between protons, so to keep a bigger nucleus
    stable it needs a larger proportion of uncharged neutrons.)  The
    two smaller pieces each have a smaller ratio of neutrons to
    protons than the original heavy nucleus, so a few neutrons are
    left over after each fission reaction.  Thus, a single neutron
    falling into a heavy nucleus (most famously Uranium 235 or
    Plutonium 239) causes it to fission, producing several more
    neutrons.  The neutrons have to slow down by pinballing off other
    nuclei, but if there is a big enough lump of fissionable material
    for them to do so, those second generation neutrons can produce
    several more fission events, and the number of fissions grows
    exponentially with the number of generations since the original
    fission event.  This is the famous nuclear chain reaction that
    leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki and which is used by all nuclear
    power plants.</p>

  <p>There is no real analog for the nuclear fission chain reaction in
    ordinary chemistry.  The closest thing is probably a laser, where
    one photon can trigger an excited atom to decay and release a
    second photon without destroying the original photon, causing a
    similar exponentially growing cascade of photons.  A fission chain
    reaction has no activation energy (the nucleus actually sucks the
    neutron in) so the temperature of the material does not matter -
    it can happen even if the material starts near absolute zero
    temperature.</p>

  <p>Nuclear fusion, on the other hand, has an activation energy which
    is extremely large by chemical standards, since the reactants have
    to hit with enough energy to overcome the very large electrical
    repulsion from their positive charges.  However, if the reactants
    are hot enough that thermal collisions can overcome this barrier,
    and if the reaction is exothermic, then it should be possible for
    the energy of the reaction (the product nuclei have more kinetic
    energy than the reactant nuclei) to heat the reactants even more,
    and to heat new reactant material to a high enough temperature for
    it to react.  This thermonuclear fusion is analogous to a burning
    mixture of chemical fuel.</p>

  <p>The temperature required for even a tiny thermal tail of
    especially fast moving reactant nuclei to fuse is of order
    5&nbsp;keV.  The unit of temperature here is the
    kilo-electron-Volt (keV), where one electron-Volt (eV) is 11,600
    Kelvin, so this is a whopping 50 million Kelvin.  If you can get
    it hotter, the reactivity goes up.  Each different fusion reaction
    has its own reactivity curve.  This reactivity has units of volume
    per time, so that multiplying it by the density of reactant nuclei
    produces the rate at which the reactants are being used up.  That
    is, reactivity times density is the probability per unit time that
    any given nucleus will react.  Thus, if you want a significant
    fraction (one e-th!) of the fuel to react, the reactivity times
    the density times the confinement time has to be at least one.
    (The probability to <em>not</em> react in time $t$ is $e^{-\alpha
    t}$ if $\alpha$ is the probabilty per unit time to react.)
    Density times confinement time is called the Lawson criterion.
    The Lawson criterion and the temperature are the main figures of
    merit for any thermonuclear fusion scheme.</p>

  <p>The <a href="./niftour.html#reactivities">final slide</a> of the
    NIF tour presentation shows the reactivities of all of the
    commonly mentioned fusion reactions as a function of temperature.
    You can see that the DT reaction $(D+T\rightarrow\alpha+n)$ has
    about 100 times higher reactivity than the second most reactive
    possibility, DD (actually two reactions, $D+D\rightarrow
    ^3\!\!He+n$ and $D+D\rightarrow T+p$).  This means to burn a DD
    plasma, you have to confine it 100 times longer than you need to
    confine DT at the same density and temperature.  Given that
    magnetic fusion has been trying for 70 years and laser fusion has
    been trying for 50 years to achieve the confinement time needed
    for DT fusion, every other fusion reaction is way out of reach and
    will remain so for a very long time - quite possibly forever.</p>

  <p>Fusion power therefore requires that you make tritium (T), since
    it is half the fuel you need for the DT fusion reaction.  You make
    tritium by bombarding lithium with neutrons.  The other half of
    the fuel, deuterium (D), is the nucleus of about one in every 6000
    hydrogen atoms in nature.  Water (H2O) is the usual source for
    manufacturing deuterium, but if you want pure deuterium you need
    to separate the one (D2O) molecule you will find in every 36
    million water molecules, which makes pure deuterium one of the
    most expensive natural substances in the world.  You often see the
    false claim that seawater fuels fusion reactors - even in places
    which you would expect to be trustworthy.  The truth is that
    fusion fuel is half lithium and half heavy water.  The notion that
    heavy water alone suffices (or that heavy water is merely seawater)
    assumes that fusion energy will come from the DD reaction, which
    burns 100 times slower than the DT reaction we have been
    struggling to confine for half a century already.</p>
  <p>I remember when I first arrived at Livermore Lab in 1980, John
    Nuckolls - my boss at the time and the inventor of laser fusion -
    was having lunch with me and the three other new hires.  Us four
    newbies were chattering away about how "practical" fusion reactors
    would use DD - or even better the proton-boron triple alpha
    reaction which produces only charged particles.  Nuckolls listened
    to us blither for a few minutes, then smiled and shut us down with
    the comment, "What's the matter boys?  DT isn't hard enough for
    you?"  Considering that a crew of several hundred of us worked our
    tails off for the next 42 years (and spent about five billion
    dollars) to barely begin to burn just a tiny bit of DT, Nuckolls
    obviously knew what he was talking about from the beginning.</p>
  <p>Canada has the largest supply of heavy water (D2O) in the world
    because their nuclear power plant design uses heavy water unlike
    essentially everyone else.  A large fraction of the heavy water
    supply in the US is tied up in the NIF laser because many of its
    optics are made from deuterated potasium dihydrogen phosphate
    (dKDP), a special salt crystal, and the several tons of heavy
    water required comprise a significant fraction of all the heavy
    water in the US.  When the laser is eventually decomissioned, we
    have to carefully redissolve those optics in heavy water and give
    it back - NIF obtained the use of this much extremely expensive
    deuterium on loan!  (Canada declined NIF's request to part with
    any of their considerably larger supply, incidentally, to give you
    an idea of just how rare and expensive heavy water is.)</p>

  <h2>Does fusion power the Sun?</h2>

  <p>Yes, but using a very different set of nuclear reactions than any
    proposed fusion power reactor on Earth.  The key difference is
    that essentially all the hydrogen in the Sun is the lightest
    isotope, so that the only nucleus that can react is just a proton.
    But the fusion reaction product, the helium nucleus (or alpha
    particle), has two neutrons in addition to two protons.  Where did
    the neutrons come from?  The answer is that the rate determining
    step in the Sun's fusion reaction is mediated by the weak nuclear
    force, which can convert protons into neutrons and vice versa, but
    which is spectacularly weaker than either the strong nuclear force
    that binds protons and neutrons together in nuclei or the
    electromagnetic force.  This very slow weak reaction in the Sun
    converts two protons into a proton, a neutron, a positron, and an
    electron neutrino (look up the famous solar neutrino problem), and
    its reactivity is so low that it takes billions of years for the
    Sun to fuse its protons into helium.  If the Sun were made of DT
    or just deuterium (or any of the other fusion reactions proposed
    for reactors), it would burn all its fuel in a few billionths or
    millionths of a second, producing a pretty impressive explosion.
    (Oddly enough, however, it's probably not as big a blast as a
    supernova, which gets most of its energy from gravitational
    collapse, making the full $E=mc^2$ available instead of just a
    fraction of a percent of it.)</p>

  <p>By contrast, all of the fusion reactions in hydrogen bombs or any
    proposed fusion power reactor only involve the strong nuclear
    force.  That is, the number of protons and neutrons are separately
    conserved, and there aren't any leptons involved (neutrinos,
    electrons, or positrons).</p>

  <h2>What is inertial confinement fusion?</h2>

  <p>The keV is actually a measure of energy - the potential energy of
    a single electron at 1000 Volts electrical potential.  When used
    as a temperature, it means that a typical particle has a random
    kinetic energy of one keV.  (Actually, the rule in statistical
    physics is "one half keV per degree of freedom on average", which
    is 3/2 keV for a single electron or ion moving in 3D.)  Chemical
    bonds all break at energies of a few eV; indeed you can rip the
    valence electrons completely off of atoms with that much energy.
    At the DT fusion ignition temperature of 5 keV, every material
    will be a highly ionized plasma.</p>

  <p>A plasma behaves like a gas, except it has a very high electrical
    conductivity.  Because of the high conductivity, you can induce
    large electrical currents in the plasma and attempt to make a
    "magnetic bottle" to confine the hot plasma for long enough to
    burn.  This is the idea behind magnetic confinement fusion.  The
    problem is that magnetic bottles are always unstable and
    leaky.</p>

  <p>An alternative strategy is the one used in hydrogen bombs (which
    are powered by thermonuclear fusion): Heat the fusion fuel rapidly
    enough for it to burn before it has time to blow apart, just like
    a chemical explosive reacts faster than it can blow apart.  This
    is called inertial confinement fusion.  The fact that hydrogen
    bombs work makes inertial confinement the only demonstrated
    technique for achieving thermonuclear fusion on Earth.  Modeling
    inertial fusion is in many ways simpler than modeling magnetic
    fusion, because for the most part you can ignore the electrical
    and magnetic properties of the fuel and model it as you would any
    other compressible fluid.  (The exception is how a material
    interacts with laser light, which very much involves the
    electrical properties of the plasma.)</p>

  <p>Imagine a sphere of DT fusion fuel that you've somehow
    instantaneously heated to 5 keV.  A rough estimate of how long it
    takes to blow apart is the time it takes for a sound wave to
    propagate from its surface to its center.  Assuming a sphere of
    radius $r$, that is $r/c,$ where $c$ is the speed of sound.  Like
    the reactivity in the Lawson criterion, the speed of sound is
    mostly a function of temperature.  Thus, the density-confinement
    time product in the Lawson criterion is equivalent to the
    density-radius product $\rho r$ in inertial confinement fusion.
    For the DT reaction, the number you need to exceed to burn half
    the fuel before it blows apart turns out to be about
    6&nbsp;g/cm&sup2;.  In fact, the very rough approximate formula we
    use in ICF (inertial confinement fusion) taget design is that the
    fraction of DT fuel that will burn up before disassembly is $\rho
    r/(\rho r + 6\,\textnormal{g/cm}^2)$.  (For any other fusion
    reaction, you need a $\rho r$ product of at least a few hundred
    g/cm&sup2;.)</p>

  <p>We usually shoot for $\rho r=3$&nbsp;g/cm&sup2;, which is enough
    to burn up about a third of the fuel according to the formula.
    The energy content of DT fuel is $3.4\times 10^{11}$&nbsp;J/g
    (17.6&nbsp;MeV/reaction), and at $\rho r=3$&nbsp;g/cm&sup2; you'll
    burn a third of the fuel, so you'll get a little over
    $10^{11}$&nbsp;J/g.  The NIF laser was designed for a maximum DT
    yield of about 20&nbsp;MJ (or 10 pounds of TNT equivalent), which
    means the mass of DT fuel at NIF must be about 200&nbsp;&micro;g.
    To get $\rho r=3$&nbsp;g/cm&sup2; with 200&nbsp;&micro;g of fuel,
    you can work out that you need a DT fuel radius of about
    40&nbsp;&micro;m and a density a bit over 700&nbsp;g/cc.</p>

  <p>That 700&nbsp;g/cc required DT fuel density is pretty daunting -
    the densest element is osmium with a density of 22.5&nbsp;g/cc,
    and more importantly the density of solid DT ice is only
    0.25&nbsp;g/cc.  That is, if you start with solid DT fuel, you
    need to crush it into a volume 3000 times smaller than its initial
    volume.  If you want to use a lower density, you need to be able
    to withstand more than a 20&nbsp;MJ explosion, with the output
    energy scaling inversely as the square of the fuel density.  The
    laser energy you need to ignite the lower density target also
    scales inversely as the square of the fuel density - the 2&nbsp;MJ
    NIF laser size was chosen because we thought we had a fighting
    chance of achieving a factor of 3000 fuel compression.  If you
    want a lower fuel compression, you need to build a bigger, more
    expensive laser to drive it.  Note that the scientific breakeven
    shot produced only 3&nbsp;MJ yield, not 20, because we haven't yet
    managed to get the full factor of 3000 fuel compression.</p>

  <p>The only convincing way to both compress the fuel to
    700&nbsp;g/cc density and simultaneously heat it to 5&nbsp;keV
    temperature is to begin with a hollow spherical shell of DT ice
    and apply a huge pressure to the outside of it to implode the
    shell at a very high speed.  For example, a DT ice shell 1&nbsp;mm
    in radius and 64&nbsp;&micro;m thick will weigh 200&nbsp;&micro;g,
    which is pretty close to the DT fuel dimensions of an actual NIF
    ignition target.  If you can accelerate this shell inward to a
    speed of about 350&nbsp;km/s, it will hit center in a few
    nanoseconds, and the force of that train wreck can be enough to
    both compress and heat the fuel to thermonuclear ignition.  In
    order to get to 700&nbsp;g/cc, you have to be very careful to keep
    the imploding shell at a relatively low temperature while you are
    accelerating it - a hot shell will be too stiff (a high
    temperature gas is less compressible than a low temperature gas)
    and you won't get the required density.</p>

  <p>You need to apply several hundred million atmospheres of pressure
    to the outside of the fuel shell (as you can work out from the
    numbers in the previous couple of paragraphs).  To do that, you
    surround the DT fuel shell with a shell of ablator material - it
    was pure carbon in the form of diamond in the NIF shot that
    ignited.  (Actually, it was a thin shell of pure diamond followed
    by a diamond shell with a fraction of a percent tungsten doping to
    shield the fuel from x-rays that would otherwise preheat it,
    followed by an outermost shell of pure diamond.)  You can either
    shoot the lasers at the outside of this ablator, called direct
    drive, or you can put the capsule inside a little oven you heat
    with the lasers and let the thermal radiation from the oven drive
    the ablator.  We chose the latter scheme, called indirect drive,
    for most of the NIF ignition experiments, because even though it
    is less efficient, you get much more spherically symmetric
    ablation pressure that way.  Since you have to crush that
    1&nbsp;mm fuel shell down to 0.04&nbsp;mm for it to ignite,
    keeping everything perfectly symmetric is of paramount
    importance.</p>

  <h2>When will we have fusion energy?</h2>

  <p>My personal best guess, after spending 40 years working on
    inertial confinement fusion, is never.</p>
  <p>Paradoxically, I'd say the main lesson to be learned from NIF
    reaching scientific breakeven is that imploding a fuel capsule is
    every bit as difficult as it sounds: You have to start with a
    perfectly spherical shell of cryogenic DT ice and implode it with
    near perfect symmetry by a factor of at least 25 in radius.  The
    slightest imperfections do indeed cause it to fail.  This is
    expensive but - finally - barely possible to do maybe a few times
    a year with a lot of hard work by several hundred scientists and
    engineers.</p>
  <p>But in order to build a typical 1&nbsp;GW power plant, you would
    need to build and shoot roughly a million of these capsules per
    day (say 10 per second producing 100&nbsp;MJ each, and not
    allowing for any inefficiency in converting the explosion energy
    to electricity).  The total world usage of electricity is
    3000&nbsp;GW, which means you need to shoot a billion of these
    perfect capsules a day to provide even a third of the world's
    electricity.  Even the scaling up of the semiconductor industry in
    the past six decades to its current level of about a trillion
    chips a year pales in comparison to what it would take to build
    and shoot a billion ICF capsules a year.  It's just not practical,
    even before discussing the huge problems with building the laser
    and reaction chamber.</p>
  <p>It's almost as obvious that magnetic confinement fusion will
    never produce economical electrical power.  The ITER test reactor
    under construction in France will have cost tens of billions of
    dollars and taken decades to build before it begins operation in
    the latter half of this decade.  It has only a fraction of the
    systems which would be necessary for an actual fusion power
    reactor.  In particular, it will be the first tests of the
    extremely difficult lithium blanket necessary to breed tritium
    fuel for any fusion reactor.  Again personally, I think that will
    turn out to be an extremely difficult and expensive
    technology.</p>
  <p>A single 1&nbsp;GW DT fusion power reactor of any sort burns at
    least 50&nbspg of tritium a day, or 20&nbsp;kg every year.  (The
    US consumes 500&nbsp;GW of electricity.)  The total amount of
    tritium ever produced in the US (nearly all of it for nuclear
    weapons use) is about 250&nbsp;kg.  Tritium is extremely
    radioactive and requires special handling even in microscopic
    quantities.  It is also a "special nuclear material" which is
    carefully controlled and monitored because of its use in nuclear
    weapons.</p>
  <p>Also, any sort of fusion power plant will produce large
    quantities of radioactive material in addition to its tritium
    fuel, created by the intense neutron radiation.  The single
    3&nbsp;MJ NIF shot created enough radiation to force the target
    chamber area to remain evacuated for several days (that is,
    workers could only enter the area around the target chamber for a
    few minutes at a time).  A 1&nbsp;GW reactor would shoot a million
    targets each with 30 times the NIF yield every day, creating a
    constant radiation level at least a million times larger than this
    near the reaction chamber.  The same would be true of a magnetic
    fusion reactor.  The only advantage of fusion over fission as far
    as radioactivity is concerned is that by carefully selecting the
    materials you use to build the reaction chamber, you can arrange
    for most of the induced radioactivity to consist of relatively
    short half-life isotopes.  During operation, the area near the
    fusion reactor will be inaccessible due to high radiation
    levels.</p>
  <p>In summary, if you want nuclear power at any price remotely
    competitive with what you now pay for electricity, your only
    practical option is fission.  Solving its safety and waste
    problems is almost certainly easier than developing fusion energy.
    Personally, I think renewable energy is the only long term
    solution, with fission energy being a possible short term
    necessity.</p>

  <h2>Why did we build the NIF laser?</h2>

  <p>Achieving thermonuclear fusion at laboratory scale has become
    a grand scientific challenge.  It is a spectacularly difficult
    engineering problem which pushes us to and beyond the limits
    of what is possible.  As John F. Kennedy said in a famous speech
    about the Apollo moon program:
    <blockquote>We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the
      moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they
      are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will
      serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and
      skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to
      accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we
      intend to win, and the others, too.
    </blockquote>
  </p>
  <p>Unlike magnetic fusion, laser fusion at the NIF does have an
    immediate practical benefit in addition to "organizing and
    measuring the best of our energies and skills".  That is, the NIF
    laser enables us to study the physics of materials at pressures
    and temperatures important for the operation of nuclear weapons.
    The ability to ignite thermonuclear fusion reactions with similar
    burn rates as in weapons provides neutron fluxes which occur
    nowhere else.  This unique capability of NIF is one of the main
    reasons the US can maintain our nuclear stockpile without doing
    underground nuclear tests.  The US has not set off a nuclear
    explosion since 1993, and NIF plays an important role in our
    ability to continue adhering to the comprehensive test ban.
    Without the experimental tests we can perform at the NIF, we have
    no way to verify new computer models that take advantage of modern
    hardware, or to test new theories about things we never understood
    about old nuclear explosions.</p>
