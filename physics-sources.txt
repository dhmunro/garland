  - This is the most complete and best description of how physicists
    strive to think about their subject, from mechanics and statistical
    physics to elementary electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.
    Many people find it not helpful for preparing for physics tests
    and solving class problems.  Read it for the viewpoint and clarity
    of description - why you should believe the principles and how you
    should think about them.  The individual chapters often don't
    depend very strongly on previous chapters, but stand alone.

Einstein

  1905 Annalen der Physik
    https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/100  Photoelectric
    https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/137  Brownian motion
    https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/154  Special relativity
    https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/186  E=mc2
    - Einstein is a spectacularly clear writer, and these are the output
      of his Annum Mirabilis of 1905.  (Newton's Annum Mirabilis was 1666,
      but he didn't publish any of it until 1687.)  The photoelectric effect
      paper is what he won his Nobel Prize for.  The Brownian motion paper
      was the coup-de-grace for any opposition to the reality of atoms -
      the only directly observable effect of atoms until the invention of
      the electron microscope.  The special relativity paper requires more
      knowledge of Maxwell's equations than most high school students will
      have, but again you don't really have to follow all the math to
      benefit from reading it.  The E=mc2 paper is the shortest of the
      bunch, direct and to the point, essentially an addendum to the
      special relativity paper.

    - These are, in the opinion of many, the most important work Einstein
      ever did.  Heisenberg began his development of quantum mechanics
      from this starting point.  They provide a simple yet tolerably
      complete framework for how light and atoms interact, defining
      what the end goal of atomic physics needs to be.  They are clearer
      than most textbook descriptions a century later (an almost
      incredible feat), because he anticipates and addresses exactly
      the points that are most confusing from the standpoint of Newtonian
      mechanics.

Newton
  Principia  https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mathematical_Principles_of_Natural_Philosophy_(1846)
  - Read System of the World addendum first - this was Newton's summary of
    Principia written in English for popular consumption.
  Opticks  https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/33504
  - This is a tremendously important book, even though it is just a collection
    of what amount to Newton's lab notebooks.  It's in the form of queries and
    descriptions of experiments and his interpretations of his observations.
    This is raw genius on display.  Nothing he does is hard to understand,
    but the things he thinks to try (along with explanation of why) are
    simply staggering.  For example, he studies the colors of soap bubbles
    on a glass table (under a bell jar) so that he can crawl under the
    table and see that the colors are complementary when viewed from the
    inside.  It has mistakes of theory as well (unlike Principia), because
    Newton did not believe light was a wave.  And yet, he measures the
    thickness of films which produce various interference colors and
    makes a perfect table we recognize as wavelength versus color!
    Beyond brilliant and extremely thought provoking.

Here are a couple of other things of historical interest that are not online:

Galileo
  Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems [I cant find English online?]
  - Fantastically entertaining and well-written account of doing science.
    He goes after his detractors in print, which is no longer the fashion
    in science writing.  Unlike anything else on this list, there are quite
    a few outright errors (e.g.- he demonstrates that a chain hangs in a
    parabola, but it's really a catenary).  See if you can spot them.
    Despite this, it's one of the most influential and important scientific
    works ever written.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtle_is_the_Lord
- This is by far the best biography of Einstein, written by a friend and
  fellow physicist (Abraham Pais).  There's a lot of physics here, since
  Pais includes technical explanations of exactly how Einstein's work
  influenced the subject.  There is essentially no area of modern physics
  that doesn't have Einstein's fingerprints all over it, making him
  utterly unique.
