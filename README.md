Assorted Topics in Physics
==========================

Prepared for an APS "Physicist-To-Go" visit to North Garland High School
in Garland, Texas by David Munro in 2022.

Each topic is a web page containing a few animated viewgraphs.  The
animations are done using the javascript D3 library starting from SVG
graphics prepared using Inkscape.
