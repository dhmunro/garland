    <h1>Understanding Spacetime Geometry</h1>

    <h2>Things just will not go faster than light</h2>

    <p>The fact that nothing can move faster than light - the
      centerpiece Einstein&apos;s special theory of relativity - is
      hard to fathom.  To our intuition, based on senses unable to
      detect any motion remotely as fast as light, it seems absurd.
      Worse, it directly contradicts Newton&apos;s cherished laws of
      mechanics.  Yet the truth is that space and time are connected
      in a very beautiful and completely unexpected way by the speed
      of light.  Spacetime has a geometry with all the richness of
      Euclidean geometry, where time is a new direction analogous to
      the familiar directions in space.  But before we discuss all
      that, we need to address the elephant in the room: the seemingly
      impossible fact that nothing can move faster than light.</p>
    <p>The reason anyone believes this is simple: When you do
      experiments with equipment built to measure very high speed
      motion you find that no matter how long and hard you push on
      them, things just will not go faster than light.  The speed of
      light is extravagantly faster than anything any animal can
      sense.  Light reaches the Moon in a bit over a second, and if
      bent into a circle a light pulse would complete the Earth&apos;s
      orbit around the Sun in 52 minutes.  The only objects we can
      accelerate to light-like speeds are subatomic particles, so the
      most direct experimental evidence that nothing can move faster
      than light comes from particle accelerators.</p>
    <p>A proton accelerator uses magnets to force the protons to orbit
      around a large ring.  By applying an electric field each time
      a proton (a bunch of protons in practice) passes a given
      position in the ring, you can give it more and more momentum
      (applying a force to anything means changing its momentum).  At
      first, the protons move around the ring faster and faster as you
      expect.  But as they approach the speed of light, they
      don&apos;t go around the ring any faster.  Their momentum
      continues to increase, however, as you can measure from the
      recoil when they hit something.  You can increase the proton
      momentum and kinetic energy indefinitely as its speed inches
      closer to the speed of light, contradicting Newton&apos;s laws
      of motion and, incidentally, your intuition.</p>

    <h2>Light is a wave that propagates through empty space</h2>

    <p>Maxwell pictured light as an electromagnetic wave propagating
      through some &ldquo;aether&rdquo; filling all space, analogous
      to the way a sound wave propagates through a material.  The
      stiffness and mass of the material determine the speed of the
      sound waves.  For electromagnetic waves, electrical inductance
      and capacitance play the roles of mass and stiffness to
      determine the speed of light.  Using Maxwell&apos;s equations
      you can calculate the speed of light, without directly measuring
      it, from the inductance and capacitance of empty space.  The
      fact that this indirect calculation exactly matches the measured
      speed of light convinced everyone that light is an
      electromagnetic wave in the first place.</p>

    <p>Every kind of wave propagates at its wave
      speed <em>relative</em> to the medium that supports the
      vibrations.  For example, sound waves in air travel slower
      upwind than downwind - the speed of the air subtracts or adds to
      the speed of the sound waves.  Physicists, most famously
      Michelson and Morely, designed rather subtle optical experiments
      to detect the motion of the Earth relative to the presumed
      aether.  All such experiments came up empty handed - there is no
      change in the speed of light depending on its direction, or on
      the direction the Earth is moving through space.</p>
    <p>There is no aether wind, so no longer any reason to imagine
      aether exists at all.  Space is empty: You can&apos;t tell if
      you are moving through space - there&apos;s never any wind in
      your face.  And crucially if two observers are moving relative
      to each other, neither can detect any wind or any indication
      they are moving through space.  This is a real crisis for
      understanding the nature of light: Light is a wave that
      propagates through empty space.  How does that make sense?</p>
    <p>Unlike sound waves, light waves always move at the same speed
      in every direction, no matter how fast or in what direction you
      (as an observer) are moving.  This experimental fact would have
      shocked Maxwell: The final sentence of his massive <em>Treatise
      On Electricity and Magnetism</em>, his epitome of his own
      seminal masterwork, reads:
      <blockquote>Hence all these theories lead to the conception of a
        medium in which the propagation <em>[of light]</em> takes
        place, and if we admit this medium as an hypothesis, I think
        it ought to occupy a prominent place in our investigations,
        and that we ought to endeavor to construct a mental
        representation of all the details of its action, and this has
        been my constant aim in this treatise.
      </blockquote>
      But apparently Maxwell's hypothesis is wrong: There is no medium
      for light waves.
    </p>

    <h2>A spacetime analog of graph paper</h2>

    <p>This constancy of the speed of light through empty space, at
      first glance so strange, is the key to discovering the wonderful
      geometry fusing space and time into spacetime.  The experimental
      results about high speed motion and the behavior of light waves
      turn out to make perfect sense, once you understand the behavior
      of moving clocks.  That is, you need to work out how the
      spacetime coordinates $(x,t)$ assigned to any event by one
      observer are related to the coordinates $(x',t')$ assigned to
      the same event by a moving observer.</p>
    <p>Finding the spatial coordinates $(x,y)$ of a landmark so you
      can plot its position on a map is the job of a surveyor.  The
      actual measurements the surveyor makes are angles; only after
      considerable calculations do these angles become simple
      coordinates $(x,y)$ of the map.  That is, in real life,
      coordinates of an object are not just given, but require
      considerable work to determine in each specific case.  In order
      to survey spacetime accurately enough to describe motions near
      light-speed, you will also need to do some calculation: You need
      to correct the times you see things happen for the transit time
      of the light or other signal you use to detect the event.
      (Roemer first noticed this in the seventeenth century trying to
      understand the motion of the moons of Jupiter.)</p>
    <img style="width:50%;margin:1em;float:right;"
         src="space02.svg" alt="Beacon coordinate system" />
    <p>One good way to survey the spacetime plane is to use two
      beacons at some great distance - one at large positive $x$ and
      one at large negative $x.$ Each beacon emits a series of light
      pulses at some rate; the rates do not need to be equal, but the
      interval between pulses from either beacon should be fixed.
      Imagine the beacons are two pulsars ticking away with their
      fantastic precision.  You know by experiment the speed of light
      $c$ is the same for every pulse and for any observer.  Since the
      two beacons lie in opposite directions, the pulse trajectories
      weave a tilted grid in a spacetime diagram.  The slopes of the
      grid lines are always $\pm 1/c$ for any observer.</p>
    <p>Thus two beacons emitting light pulses naturally define a
      coordinate grid in the spacetime between them - a spacetime
      analog of graph paper in the Euclidean plane!  Unfortunately
      this so-called <em>null coordinate</em> system is not the space
      and time coordinates $(x,t)$ you need to understand - like any
      survey technique some calculation is unavoidable.  Other than
      that, this grid of light pulses is great.  To use it, you simply
      define one pulse crossing event as your coordinate origin, and
      count the pulses from either direction to get the null
      coordinates $(u_+,u_-)$ of any other crossing event in the grid,
      just like using graph paper.  The huge advantage of these null
      coordinates is that every observer, no matter how they are
      moving, must agree on the number of pulses from each beacon
      $(u_+,u_-)$ separating any two events in spacetime.</p>

    <h2>Invariance of speed of light contradicts absolute time</h2>

    <p>Although any observer, no matter how they are moving, can
      locate an event in this pulsar beacon grid just by counting the
      pulses from each beacon, you need to do a bit of calculation -
      again like any surveyor - to convert those pulse counts into
      position and time coordinates.</p>

         src="space03.svg" alt="Beacon coordinate system" />
    <p>If $T_+$ is the interval between pulses for the beacon on the
      left, and $T_-$ is the interval between pulses for the beacon on
      the right, then the equations for grid lines of $u_+$th
      rightward pulse and of the $u_-$th leftward pulse are:

      \begin{equation}\begin{array}{rcl}
      t - x/c &=& T_+ u_+ \\
      t + x/c &=& T_- u_- \end{array}\end{equation}

      The surveying calculations to convert beacon grid coordinates
      $(u_+,u_-)$ into position and time coordinates $(x,t)$ are
      therefore:

      \begin{equation}\begin{array}{rcl}
      x/c &=& (T_-u_- - T_+u_+)/2 \\
      t &=& (T_-u_- + T_+u_+)/2 \end{array}\end{equation}
    </p>
    <p>You have set the beacon coordinate origin to a particular pulse
      crossing where $u_+=u_-=0.$ The points the observer considers to
      happen at the same point in space as this origin event are the
      points where $x=0,$ which are the line where $u_+/u_-=T_-/T_+$
      in the beacon coordinates according to equations (2).</p>
    <p>Consider now a second observer who moves from left to right
      with a speed $v$ as measured by the first observer.  This moving
      observer sees the leftward pulses spaced by a shorter interval
      $T'_-$ and the rightward pulses by a longer interval $T'_+$ than
      the first observer.  The grid line equations in $(x',t')$
      coordinates are exactly the same as (1), but with primed
      position and time and $T'_\pm$ pulse intervals.  Thus, the line
      where $x'=0$ is where $u_+/u_-=T'_-/T'_+$ in beacon coordinates,
      and of course where $x=vt$ in the coordinates of the first
      observer.  Substituting $x=vt$ into equations (1) and taking
      their ratio, and putting $u_+/u_-=T'_-/T'_+$, you find the
      relation between the ratio of pulse intervals experienced by the
      two observers:

       \begin{equation}
        \frac{T'_+}{T'_-} = \frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}\frac{T_+}{T_-}.
       \end{equation}

      At $x'=0$ the primed versions of equations (1) do not depend on
      the pulse speed $c$, so equation (3) is how the ratio of pulse
      intervals changes as a function of observer velocity for any
      kind of pulses that move at the same speed $c$ in both
      directions for the first observer - light, sound, or even a
      catapult throwing rocks could be your beacons.  Newton would
      have arrived at this formula, with the stipulation that $c$
      is the pulse speed measured by the stationary observer.</p>
    <p>The special feature of light waves, that they always appear to
      travel in every direction at speed $c,$ finally comes into play
      when you work out what events the two observers consider
      simultaneous.  The events which are simultaneous with $(0,0)$
      are where $t=0$ according to the first observer, but where
      $t'=0$ according to the second.  Plugging $t'=0$ into the primed
      version of equations (1) gives $u_+/u_-=-T'_-/T'_+,$ the negative
      of the beacon coordinate equation for $x'=0.$ When you
      substitute this into equations (2), you just reverse the
      signs of the second terms on the right hand sides relative to
      the $x'=0$ case.  Therefore, the ratio of equations (2)
      where $t'=0$ is the reciprocal of what it was where $x'=0$:

      \begin{equation} ct/x=v/c. \end{equation}

      The points with $t'=0$ are not simultaneous for the first
      observer: $t$ depends on $x$!</p>

    <img style="width:50%;margin:1em;float:right;"
         src="space04.svg" alt="x'-t' axis symmetry" />

    <p>Another way to say the same thing is to note that if $t'=0$
      passes through $(u_+,u_-),$ then $x'=0$ must pass through
      $(-u_+,u_-).$ This reflection symmetry of the position and time
      axes with respect to the beacon coordinate grid is the only way
      the speed of light can have the same fixed value $c$ for every
      moving observer.  In the position-time corodinates of one
      observer, it means that the slopes of the world line and line of
      simultaneity of a second observer must be reciprocals as in
      equation (4).</p>
    <p>This is the revolutionary feature of special relativity:
      Simultaneity is no longer absolute, but depends on the motion of
      the observer.  All of the things that seem strange about
      relativistic mechanics trace back to this one fact: You
      intuitively expect that events at different places which are
      simultaneous for one observer will be simultaneous for all
      observers.  But the cold experimental fact is that simultaneity
      is relative.  Newton&apos;s model of absolute time is
      inconsistent with the invariance of the speed of light.</p>
    <p>A geometrical way to think about what you&apos;ve just
      discovered is this:
      <div style="display: block;margin: 1em;">
        If the world line of a moving observer passes through events
        $(0,0)$ and $(x,t)$, then the events $(0,0)$ and $(ct,x/c)$
        will be simultaneous for that observer.</div>
      This relation is the spacetime analog of perpendicularity in
      Euclidean geometry:
      <div style="display: block;margin: 1em;">
        If one line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(x,y)$, then the line
        passing through $(0,0)$ and $(-y,x)$ will be perpendicular to
        it.</div>
    </p>

    <h2>Invariance of area and the spacetime interval</h2>

    <p>You cannot get any farther using only the experimental fact
      that the speed of light is the same in all directions no matter
      how you are moving through space.  To completely specify
      $(x',t')$ in terms of $(x,t),$ you need to know how each pulse
      interval $T_\pm$ varies with observer motion individually, not
      just their ratio (3).  The additional fact you need comes from
      the symmetry of the situation.  The only difference between the
      two observers is that from the point of view of the first, the
      second is moving to the right, while from the point of view of
      the second, the first is moving to the left.</p>
    <p>Both observers can compute the area (in units of distance times
      time) of any region of spacetime.  If one measured a larger
      spacetime area than the other, it would mean that moving to the
      right is somehow different than moving to the left.  If space is
      left-right symmetric, then both observers must measure the same
      area.  The two pulse beacons naturally divide spacetime into
      parallelogram regions.</p>

    <p>One of the parallelogram cells in the grid of beacon lines has
      an area in the spacetime plane of $cT_+T_-/2$ (you can prove this
      as if it were an ordinary Euclidean figure), so the symmetry
      condition is

      \begin{equation} T'_+T'_-=T_+T_- \end{equation}

      (Newton or Maxwell would dispute this equation because they
      believed $c$ would be different not only for the two observers
      but also for the two directions of propagation.)  If instead of
      adding and subtracting the grid line equations (1) to find $x$
      and $t$ you multiply them, you get:

      \[ t^2 - x^2/c^2 = T_+T_-u_-u_+ \]

      From equation (5) you see that if the coordinates of any event
      for the first observer are $(x,t)$ and the coordinates of the
      same event are $(x',t')$ for the second observer, then

      \begin{equation} c^2t^2 - x^2 = c^2t'^2 - x'^2. \end{equation}

      This is the spacetime equivalent of the Pythagorean theorem in
      the Euclidean plane; instead of distance squared, the invariant
      quantity is called the spacetime interval between events (the
      second event is the origin $(0,0)$).</p>
    <p>The Pythogorean theorem follows from the invariance of area in
      the plane under rotation.  The fact that the interval and
      distance formulas both involve the squares of the coordinates
      reflects their connection to area invariance.  The only
      difference - and it is a huge difference - is that in spacetime,
      the Pythagorean plus sign becomes a minus sign.  This is the
      same sign difference that appears in the rule for orthogonality.
      (Orthogonal is the word for both the relation between a world
      line and its line of simultaneity in spacetime, and for
      perpendicular in Euclidean geometry.)</p>
    <p>The minus sign in the spacetime interval formula (6) has
      profound consequences which cause some confusion interpreting
      spacetime diagrams.  Although areas in a spacetime diagram work
      exactly the same as areas in the Euclidean plane, distances do
      not.  Two events which are very far apart in the spacetime
      diagram may have a very small interval between them.  Unlike
      small distances, small intervals are useless for determining
      proximity of events in spacetime.  When you look at a spacetime
      diagram, your mind will interpret the figure as if it were drawn
      in a Euclidean plane, which can be confusing - beware that
      Euclidean distances have no meaning.  For example, in a
      spacetime diagram, the <em>longest</em> interval between two
      events is a straight line - the old saying is turned on its
      head!  Pay attention to areas in a spacetime diagram, but try to
      ignore apparent lengths!</p>
    <p>Another interesting consequence of area invariance follows
      when you combine equations (3) and (5), deriving the formulas
      for how the individual pulse intervals $T_\pm$ differ between
      observers whose relative velocity is $v$:

      \begin{equation}
      \frac{T'_+}{T_+} = \frac{T_-}{T'_-} = \sqrt{\frac{1+v/c}{1-v/c}}.
      \end{equation}

      This is the relativistically correct formula for the Doppler
      shift - the amount a frequency shifts when you move toward or
      away from its source.  Unlike (3), equation (7) differs from the
      Newtonian version - the invariance of $c$ matters here.  The
      Newtonian version lacks the appealing $\pm v$ symmetry of this
      relativistic formula, because the wind breaks the left-right
      symmetry for at least one of the two observers.
    </p>

    <h2>Spacetime boost is the analog of Euclidean rotation</h2>

    <p>Assuming $c=1$ makes the correspondence between spacetime and
      Euclidean geometry clearer.  You can drop all the $c$ factors if
      you work in a system of units in which $c=1.$ For example, you
      can require that all times are measured in years, and all
      distances are measured in light-years.  Keeping the $c$ factors
      is equivalent to, say, measuring horizontal distances in
      kilometers and vertical distances in meters.  While this is a
      good practical choice for hikers and pilots, no one wants to
      write the formulas of coordinate geometry with explicit factors
      of 1000 multiplying all the $x$ coordinates - the formulas are
      simpler and easier to remember if you assume all the coordinates
      have been converted to common units.</p>
    <p>With $c=1,$ light pulses travel along the 45 degree lines
      $x=\pm t$ in spacetime diagrams.  The formula for the spacetime
      interval separating $(0,0)$ from $(x,t)$ becomes simply
      $t^2-x^2.$ The orthogonality relation becomes that the spacetime
      direction $(t,x)$ is orthogonal to $(x,t).$ Once again, this
      means that an observer whose time axis passes through $(x,t)$
      will have their position axis pass through $(t,x)$ (assuming
      they take $(0,0)$ as their origin).</p>
    <p>In the Euclidean plane, you are free to choose any direction
      $(a,b)$ as your $x'$-axis, with the perpendicular direction
      $(-b,a)$ becoming your $y'$-axis.  The transformation from
      $(x,y)$ coordinates to $(x',y')$ coordinates is a rotation.
      If $(a,b)$ is a unit vector with $a^2+b^2=1,$ the formulas
      relating the rotated coordinates back to the original
      coordinates are
      
      \begin{equation}\begin{array}{rcl}
      x &=& ax' - by' \\ y &=& bx' + ay'.
      \end{array}\end{equation}

    <p>The spacetime plane distinguishes two fundamentally different
      kinds of directions $(a,b)$ (again relative to some origin event
      $(0,0)$): Directions with positive interval $b^2-a^2\gt 0$ are
      called <em>timelike</em>, and may serve as your $t'$-axis.
      Conversely, directions with negative interval $b^2-a^2\lt 0$ are
      called <em>spacelike</em>, and may serve as your $x'$-axis.  A
      spacelike $(a,b)$ as a time axis would imply an observer moving
      faster than light, which you know never happens.  If $(a,b)$ is
      any spacetime vector with unit interval $b^2-a^2=1,$ it is
      timelike and can be the $t'$-axis of a moving observer.  The
      space direction for this observer will be $(b,a),$ so the moving
      observer&apos;s $(x',t')$ coordinates are related to the
      original $(x,t)$ by

      \begin{equation}\begin{array}{rcl}
      x &=& ax' + bt' \\ t &=& bx' + at'.
      \end{array}\end{equation}

      This analog of Euclidean rotation is called a <em>boost</em>,
      and the boost formula (9) is called the Lorentz transformation.
      Note that $x'=0$ is the line where $x/t=b/a,$ so the primed
      observer has velocity $v=b/a$ relative the unprimed
      observer. (When $c=1$, note that velocity $v$ means the unitless
      ratio $v/c.$)</p>
    <p>Lorentz transformations are usually written in terms of the
      velocity $v$ rather than the unit direction $(a,b)$ of the new
      time axis.  Defining

      \begin{equation}\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-v^2}, \end{equation}

      because $b^2-a^2=1,$ the timelike unit spacetime vector is
      $(a,b)=(\gamma v,\gamma)$.  A spacetime vector is called
      a <em>4-vector</em> because in general it will have three
      spatial components and one time component.</p>
    <p>The unit 4-vector $(\gamma v,\gamma)$ is called
      <em>4-velocity</em>; it is the unit 4-vector in the direction of
      the world line of an observer with velocity $v.$ The direction
      of the spatial coordinate - the line of simultaneity - for this
      same observer is $(b,a)=(\gamma,\gamma v),$ the second column of
      the Lorentz transformation matrix (9). A 4-vector generally has
      both a direction and a magnitude, but the 4-velocity always has
      unit magnitude.  A 4-velocity indicates a timelike direction in
      spacetime.  Ordinary velocity is just one component of
      4-velocity.  Notice that when the ordinary velocity is zero, the
      4-velocity is $(0,1)$ - the direction of the time axis for a
      stationary observer.</p>
    <p>A 4-vector, like vectors in general, represents something with
      direction and magnitude which all observers agree upon, like the
      spacing between two events, or the spacetime direction
      (4-velocity if timelike!) from one event to another.  The
      specific coordinates, however, depend on the observer.  The
      Lorentz transformation (9) is how you boost 4-vector coordinates
      for one observer to find the coordinates of the same 4-vector
      for a moving observer.  In (9), it is written for the event
      coordinate vector coordinates $(x,t),$ but it applies to any
      4-vector coordinates.  If you boost the coordinates of a
      4-velocity, for example, you get the famous relativistic
      velocity addition formula.</p>
    <p>Notice that there are two directions in the spacetime plane
      which are neither timelike nor spacelike: $(\pm 1,1),$ the
      directions of the beacon grid lines.  These directions are
      called lightlike; they have no analog in Euclidean geometry.
      Lightlike directions cannot be normalized to unit 4-vectors
      because they have zero interval.  That is, a lightlike direction
      is orthogonal to itself.  No 4-velocity can be lightlike; a
      lightlike direction is neither a world line nor a line of
      simultaneity for any observer.  This is a logical consequence of
      the fact that the speed of light appears to have the same value
      for every observer no matter how they are moving.  Time and
      position do not exist for photons or anything else moving at the
      speed of light.  (Null coordinate systems like the beacon grid
      are useful, but quite different from position-time systems; for
      example their $\pm$ lightlike axes are not, and cannot be,
      orthogonal.)</p>

    <p>A circle is the locus of points equidistant from a center in
      Euclidean geometry.  The points $(x,y)$ which are a distance $r$
      from $(0,0)$ satisfy the equation $x^2+y^2=r^2.$ Arguably the
      simplest of all shapes, circles nevertheless have a fantastic
      number of properties, taking up a large fraction of everything
      you learn in geometry.  Much of this structure has analogies in
      spacetime geometry.</p>
    <p>The events which are a constant interval from a center in
      spacetime lie on a hyperbola.  For example, events with
      $t^2-x^2=\tau^2$ all lie at the same timelike interval $\tau^2$
      from the origin $(0,0).$ The analog of radius, $\tau$ is called
      the <em>proper time</em> between $(0,0)$ and $(x,t),$ which you
      recognize as the time elapsed between the two events for an
      observer moving so they occur at the same position $x'=0.$ As
      for the circle, this hyperbola is invariant under boosts - that
      is any boost simply slides points along the hyperbola because
      boosts leave the interval invariant.  Unlike a circle, there is
      a second branch of this hyperbola representing the events which
      occurred a proper time $\tau$ <em>before</em> $(0,0),$ but
      we&apos;ll concentrate on the branch representing events
      occuring after $(0,0).$</p>
    <p>One very useful property of a circle is that for any point on
      the circle, the tangent is perpendicular to the radius.  Exactly
      the same property holds for the spacetime hyperbola, that is,
      the tangent line at any point is orthogonal to the line from
      the center $(0,0)$ to that point.  This is obvious for the
      point at $(0,\tau),$ and follows for any other point from the
      invariance of the hyperbola under boosts.  Notice that the
      four velocity of a world line connecting $(0,0)$ to an event
      $(x,t)$ on the hyperbola is $(x/\tau,t/\tau),$ so that
      $\gamma=t/\tau$ in addition to $v=x/t.$</p>
    <p>The time elapsed for the stationary observer (the one whose
      coordinates are $x$ and $t$) between the center and any event of
      on the hyperbola is $t,$ which is greater than the proper time
      $\tau$ by the factor of $\gamma,$ the time component of the
      4-velocity.  This is often described by saying that moving
      clocks tick slower ($\tau$ elapses for the moving clock while
      $t$ elapses for the stationary clock).  However, because the
      events $(0,0)$ and $(x,t)$ are separated in space according to
      the stationary observer, what is really going on is a
      disagreement between whether an implicit third event - namely
      the event at $(x,0)$ - occurred at the same time as $(0,0).$</p>
    <p>Another source of confusion is the meaning of the statement,
      &ldquo;You cannot travel faster than the speed of light.&rdquo;
      This omits the crucial phrase, &ldquo;from the point of view of
      someone who does not make the trip.&rdquo; Notice that the
      hyperbola of events at proper time $\tau$ from $(0,0)$ includes
      events at arbitrarily large distance from $x=0$ as you follow
      its asymptote.  No matter how small a time $\tau$ you choose,
      you can always reach any point in the universe in a time that
      you, the traveler, perceive as $\tau.$ The so-called cosmic
      speed limit only applies to stationary spectators, not to you
      the traveler!  For them, the elapsed time will be
      $t=\gamma\tau,$ which is potentially very much longer - in fact
      at least as long as it takes light to make the same trip.  But
      you are free to make your elapsed time $\tau$ as brief as you
      please.</p>

    <p>There are also circle-like curves of constant spacelike
      interval defined by $x^2-t^2=\chi^2.$ This $\chi$ is
      called <em>proper distance</em>, and like proper time represents
      the distance between $(0,0)$ and $(x,t)$ as measured by an
      observer for whom the events are simultaneous, $t'=0.$ All the
      events on this hyperbola are the same proper distance from the
      center $(0,0).$ The hyperbola is again invariant under boosts; a
      boost must simply slide events along the hyperbola since it
      leaves the interval unchanged.  Once again, the tangent and the
      line to the center at any event on the hyperbola are orthogonal.
      That is, an observer whose world line is tangent to the
      hyperbola perceives the center $(0,0)$ and the event $(x,t)$ on
      the hyperbola as simultaneous!</p>
    <p>The spacelike hyperbola introduces a marvelous new physical
      possibility: Since its tangent is always timelike, an object can
      follow this hyperbolic path through spacetime.  At the point
      $(\chi,0)$ the object is momentarily at rest, since the tangent
      to its world line is in the direction $(0,\chi).$ Since it is
      stationary at that instant, it will not have moved significantly
      in a short time $dt,$ so it will be very nearly at $(\chi,dt).$
      Its tangent at this new event on its world line is thus
      $(dt,\chi),$ so that its velocity has changed from zero to the
      small value $dv=dt/\chi.$ That is, the object is accelerating at
      a rate $g=dv/dt=1/\chi$ at the event $(\chi,0).$ Because the
      hyperbola is invariant under boosts, an observer momentarily
      moving at the same speed as the object at any event on its path
      will measure this same acceleration of $1/\chi.$</p>
    <p>Objects which accelerate at a constant rate follow a hyperbolic
      world line through spacetime, maintaining a constant proper
      distance $\chi=1/g$ ($\chi=c^2/g$ in units where $c\ne 1$) from
      the center of the hyperbola!  This directly explains what is
      happening to a proton in a particle accelerator: From the point
      of view of the proton, it continues to accelerate at a constant
      rate, while from our point of view in the laboratory it just
      moves farther and farther along the spacetime hyperbola, closer
      and closer to the asymptote at the speed of light.</p>
    <p>As long as the speed of the accelerating object remains much
      less than the speed of light, it is near the vertex of the
      hyperbola, and its path through spacetime is indistinguishable
      from the parabola Galileo worked out.  The fact that there is a
      point which remains a constant proper distance $\chi$ from the
      object in its instantaneous rest frame at first seems impossible
      - if you accelerate to the right you are putting an ever
      increasing distance between you and everything to your left!
      And that is true for any event at a proper distance less than
      $\chi$ (which is extremely large for any reasonable
      acceleration).  However, the &ldquo;relativistic length
      contraction&rdquo; implicit in the boost transform (9)
      eventually takes over.</p>
    <p>When you change your velocity, you are changing which distant
      events you consider simultaneous.  Distances do not really
      contract.  Instead what happens is that distant events you used
      to consider as happening long in the past you now consider to be
      simultaneous, and your relative positions have changed in that
      disputed time interval.  When you accelerate, that&apos;s how
      the center of your spacetime hyperbola can remain simultaneous
      with you.  Once again, the only really confusing feature of
      spacetime is that simultaneity depends on your motion.</p>
    <p>A central feature of general relativity - the gravitational
      redshift - falls out immediately from this hyperbola of constant
      acceleration.  Consider a second hyperbola with the same center
      but a slightly different fixed proper distance $\chi+d\chi,$ and
      you can work it out.  (Hint: Proper time along the hyperbola is
      the analog of arc length around a circle which is proportional
      to radius, the analog of proper distance.)</p>
    <p>You can also use this constant acceleration hyperbola to
      compute how long it takes to reach a distant star or galaxy if
      you accelerate at a constant rate for half the journey, then
      turn around and decelerate for the second half.  By a strange
      coincidence, one Earth gravity (9.8 m/s$^2$) turns out to be a
      hyperbola with a proper distance $\chi$ close to one light-year.
      This means that at a comfortable one gee acceleration, it takes
      about one year to begin approaching the speed of light.  At that
      rate, you can reach nearby stars in only a few years, and
      anywhere in the Milky Way in a couple of decades.</p>
    <p>Because your $\gamma=t/\tau$ continues to increase, you can in
      principle reach distant galaxies many millions of light years
      away within a human lifetime.  However, anyone you leave behind
      on Earth will age $\gamma$ times longer than you - which will be
      millions of years if you travel to another galaxy.  The cosmic
      speed limit has nothing to do with how long it takes you to make
      a journey.  Instead it&apos;s telling you about the time which
      will elapse for the people you leave behind.</p>

    <h2>Not a matter of common sense at all</h2>

    <p>Which events happen at the same position?  The phrase
      &ldquo;same position&rdquo; depends on the motion of your frame
      of reference is a matter of common sense, as Galileo pointed out
      long ago.  Which events happen at the same time?  That the
      phrase &ldquo;same time&rdquo; also depends on your frame of
      reference, on the other hand, is not a matter of common sense at
      all.  Galileo used the example of a man walking on the deck of a
      moving ship to explain how two observers in relative motion may
      reasonably disagree about whether two events took place at the
      same position.  No comparable examples drawn from common
      experiences can show that two observers in relative motion will
      also disagree about whether two events took place at the same
      time.</p>
    <p>In our common sense world, time is a completely independent
      dimension from space.  Yet when we build elaborate equipment to
      test this common sense notion, we find that part of what one
      observer calls time another will call position.  No matter what
      your state of motion, you always find that light travels in
      every direction with the same speed $c.$ The only way (or at
      least by far the simplest way) to make sense of that
      experimental fact is if time and position are both just
      directions in a unified spacetime, and those directions both
      change according to your state of motion.  Spacetime
      orthogonality specifies way the time and space axes tilt for a
      moving observer, just as perpendicularity specifies how
      Cartesian axes tilt for a rotated observer.  In spacetime, the
      invariant interval plays the role of invariant distance in the
      Euclidean plane.</p>
    <p>This rich spacetime geometry neatly explains why you just
      can&apos;t make anything move faster than light: When an object
      undergoes a constant acceleration, its world line through
      spacetime is a hyperbola which asymptotes to the speed of light.
      If the object is a rocketship with you inside, then from your
      point of view you can reach any destination in however short a
      time you please (subject only to how great an acceleration you
      are willing to endure).</p>
    <p>If you can reach anywhere in the universe in as little time as
      you please <em>without</em> going faster than light, what do you
      mean when you say you want to go <em>faster</em> than light?  Do
      you expect to go somewhere in less than no time?  What science
      fiction authors imagine is really about armchair travel - they
      want someone else to be able to travel a vast distance in a time
      short enough for their sedentary convenience so they can enjoy
      listening to the traveler&apos;s tales.  (Or they want to be the
      traveler who returns to regale their sedentary acquaintance with
      their adventures.)  The actual geometry of spacetime shows that
      such tales are pure fantasy - not because you can&apos;t make
      such a trip, but because your buddies will die before you get
      back.  The elephant in the room is pink.</p>
